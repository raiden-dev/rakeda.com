In 00\'s we all played Quake through telephone lines and didn\'t care about Internet. We were drawing by hand on the paper at school and had things to do at the streets. We learned computer at home and dreamed about the future. Which is now. Now the Web is our everyday home.<br>And that\'s why it must be comfortable!</p>\n<p>Making things easier has always been my passion. Not because I am lazy, but because I know how hard is to learn something new. Growing technologies, new inventions, it all brings new complexity and breaks the balance in the human-machine interactions. So, the world needs someone to bring it back.<br>And that\'s why I am here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n'},useData:!0})});
